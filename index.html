				<h1>Hello, I'm El Mehdi</h1>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sOWy8rR.jpg" alt="El Mehdi looking at the sky" class="img-circle">
				<p>I’m originally from Morocco, where I grew up with a deep appreciation for my culture and community. A few years ago, I made the decision to move to France to pursue a more rigorous academic path. I enrolled in the challenging preparatory classes that France is known for, and after two intense years of hard work, I was thrilled to gain admission to HEC Paris. So far, my experience at HEC has been incredibly rewarding, both academically and socially. Beyond my studies, I have a strong passion for sports, especially football and basketball, which have always played a big role in my life. Recently, I’ve also discovered a new interest in coding, and I’m diving into web development, learning how to build websites from scratch. It’s exciting to bring my creativity and problem-solving skills into this new field, and I’m eager to keep expanding my knowledge in tech.</p>
